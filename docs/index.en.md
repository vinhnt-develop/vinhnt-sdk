# Build AI agents with TypeScript

vinhnt-sdk is a modular, extensible SDK for building AI agents in TypeScript. It provides 18 packages that work together to give you a complete toolkit for creating, deploying, and managing intelligent agents.

## What is vinhnt-sdk?

vinhnt-sdk is designed from the ground up for TypeScript developers. It offers a type-safe, composable architecture that scales from simple prototypes to production deployments. Whether you're building a chatbot, an automation agent, or a complex multi-agent system, vinhnt-sdk provides the building blocks you need.

### Key Features

- **Tool System** - Define and manage tools with type-safe schemas and validation
- **Plugin Architecture** - Extend functionality through a powerful plugin system
- **Event-driven** - React to agent lifecycle events and custom events
- **Security-first** - Built-in permission system with risk-level classifications
- **Observable** - Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing capabilities

## Quick Install

```bash
pnpm add @vinhnt-sdk/core @vinhnt-sdk/tools
```

## 5-Minute Example

```typescript
import { AgentKernel, defineTool } from '@vinhnt-sdk/core'

const calculator = defineTool({
  name: 'calculator',
  description: 'Perform basic calculations',
  parameters: {
    expression: { type: 'string', description: 'Math expression' }
  },
  handler: async ({ expression }) => {
    return eval(expression)
  }
})

const kernel = new AgentKernel({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  tools: [calculator]
})

const result = await kernel.run('Calculate 15 * 23')
console.log(result)
```
